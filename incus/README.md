# Usage

- Update the pillar if migrating from LXD to Incus:
  - Rename top level key from `lxd` to `incus`
  - Rename pillar file and change top.sls if needed
  - Remove password key - Incus doesn't support password authentication

- `state.apply incus.install` - to install or update incus without initializing it

- Make migration from LXD manually if needed right after after install and before incus init: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/server_migrate_lxd/
  - Stop containers and VMs manually, sometimes there are issues on stopping them
  - `lxc config unset core.trust_password`
  - `lxd-to-incus`
  - `incus ls` to check if all containers and VMs are migrated
  - Remove snapd optionally:
    - `apt autoremove --purge snapd`
    - `rm -rf ~/snap /var/cache/snapd/`
    - `apt-mark hold snapd`

- `state.apply incus.settings` - to initialize Incus and apply settings, update images and profiles

- Apply only specific instances
```
... state.apply incus.instances pillar='{incus: {only: {"instance1.example.com"}}}'
```

- The same with allowance stop and start for changes to apply
```
... state.apply incus.instances pillar='{incus: {only: {"instance1.example.com"}, allow_stop_start: True}}'
```

# Notes on Windows

- If you delete VM and try to create the same, it may fail on "invalid main GPT header".
  You can fix this with just changing the disk size for 1 Gb. With thin provisioning in storage this bug is not reproduced.

- To install Windows from iso you need to have virtio drivers injected into iso:
  - Download ISO to server with VM.
  - `snap install distrobuilder --classic`
  - `apt-get install genisoimage libwin-hivex-perl wimtools`
  - `distrobuilder repack-windows Windows.iso Windows-distrobuilder.iso` - it will download drivers and inject them into iso.

- To attach to VGA console on VM from your PC:
  - `apt-get install virt-viewer` - this will install X11 dependencies, this is OK.
  - Install X11 server on your PC, for example https://github.com/ArcticaProject/vcxsrv.
  - Run X11 server on your PC.
  - SSH from your PC to the server with VM as root and enable X11 forwarding in SSH.
  - Check that `DISPLAY` variable is set in SSH session, like `localhost:10.0`.
  - `incus console xxx --type=vga` - this will open console in X11 window.

- You need to catch with `incus console xxx --type=vga` the first seconds of start to push any key to load from iso.
  If you didn't catch the first seconds, wait while PXE etc timeouts and EUFI shell loads.
  Then type `cls` to clear screen.
  Then type `FS0:\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` to load from iso, you also need to push any key immediately after this command.

- To configure network manually on Windows install:
  - Wait till the screen with "Let's connect you to a network" appears.
  - Push `Shift+F10` to open command prompt.
  - `netsh interface ip set address name="Local Area Connection" static 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1 1`
  - `netsh interface ip set dns "Local Area Connection" static 192.168.0.200`
  - Ofcourse you need to change IP addresses according to your network.

# Notes on VMs and Ubuntu

In case an Instance is Virtual-Machine you need to grow internal root partition size:
```
incus stop ...
lvchange --setactivationskip n /dev/vg_md2/virtual-machines_...block
lvchange --activate y /dev/vg_md2/virtual-machines_...block
parted /dev/vg_md2/virtual-machines_...block
  resizepart 2
  100%
  q
kpartx -a /dev/vg_md2/virtual-machines_...block
e2fsck -f  /dev/mapper/vg_md2-virtual--machines_...block2
resize2fs /dev/mapper/vg_md2-virtual--machines_...block2
kpartx -d /dev/vg_md2/virtual-machines_test.block
incus start ...
```
